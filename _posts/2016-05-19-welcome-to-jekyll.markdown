Hey! First post. I'll continue to come back and add to this list, but this is my collection of interactive tutorials / learning sites and some comments about getting started with programming.
My SO is doing a bit of progamming so I decided I'd write about this.

### Interactive Command Line Tutorials
* Javascript: nodeschool.io 
* R Programming: https://github.com/DataScienceSpecialization/courses

### Online interactive Tutorials
* codecademy.com
* codeschool.com

### Web ProblemSets (Do some everyday!)
* checkio.org
* empireofcode.org (Boombeach with code. Amazing)
* hackerrank.com
* codeforces

### Security ProblemSets
* overthewire.com
* pawnable.kr (A found one or two that was made difficult because of the distance between the US and Korea)

### Doc management
* Dash (Set it to a hotkey and quickly search through docs while coding. Saves a lot of time)


Though I'm not the best authority on self learning programming since I started in an academic setting with C.
I think the best thing to start with is the python, javascript, webstuff, and the commandline tutorial from codecademy.
IMO learning how to run your code from the commandline and set up everything locally is the easiest way to go from tutorials to real world.
Don't always worry too much about practicality. It's the bane of progress for most. Problem sets / algorithmic knowledge may seem impractical, but it goes a long way.
Don't stop with tutorials. Make sure you're running the code on your own machine (and completely deface it).
